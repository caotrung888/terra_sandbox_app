# React Native mini-app demo

Demonstration for creating a [React Native mini-app](https://terra.dev.teko.vn/developer/docs/miniAppIntegration/v0/guideForMiniApp/setupReactNativeApp).

## Running project

1. Run `yarn install` command in the root folder.
2. Run `yarn start` to start the Metro bundle server.
3. Run the [Android](android/README.md) app.
4. Log in to the Android app.
5. Enter a `mini-app-code` you want to start (e.g. `mini_app`). The RN app will be run locally (started in step 2).

**Note:** Please contact the Terra team to get a corresponding `mini-app-app` for your mini-app (if you want to create yours owns mini-app). If just for testing purposes, you can use `mini_app`.

For further concern, please contact Terra team.
